updateDateGrid(selectedDay)
    When it runs:
        At the start of the program, with the current day
        When the month is changed, with the first of the month
        When the user selects a non-month day
    What it does:
        Figures out the first Sunday it will consider
        Loops through all the weeks and days of the date grid 
        Colors based on whether the day is in the month
        Calls selectDay to select a day 

translateGridToDatetime()
    When it runs:
        When selecting a day from the grid
    What it does:
        Uses knowledge about the first day in the grid to figure out datetime of week2day3

selectDay()
    When it runs:
        When selecting a day from the grid, or when updateDateGrid is called
    What it does:
        Calls translateGridToDatetime to figure out day
        If the day is outside the month, calls updateDateGrid, recalls so just return
        --- else
        colors the day in dategrid by applying a class
        accesses the database to display data on the right

displayTaskData()
    Do later



selectFromCoordinates()
    Uses week# and day# to return the element with those classes



Global Variables Required:
    current month
    first day in dategrid


Ok current T
.week.week$>.day.day$>

What must clicking the days do?
    isolate the week# and day# classes, convert to grid, and convert that to datetime to select the right date


saving data: have to set item based on a time code


ORDERS OF BUSINESS:
Either implement an autosave (every 1 second asynchronously) or a timeout save based on https://stackoverflow.com/questions/4220126/run-javascript-function-when-user-finishes-typing-instead-of-on-key-up
Both options would probably work best if there was a stopping force onbeforeunload() event that makes sure it savess
ehh just did a basic autosave

Now I want to make a popup when you click on the month
Actually first just need to make next and previous month methods        

How would I do a popup window?
Maybe one absolutetly positioned div that does the blur background
And another absolutely positioned div that actually contains the functionality and is on top z-axis wise

Interjection: setting the best aspect ratio
Always want whole cell to be 16:9
if 16xWIDTH is smaller than 9xHEIGHT, base dimensions off of vw
if 9xHEIGHT is smaller than 16xWIDTH, base dimensions off of vh
once you go beyond 1600px or 900px, be more careful
once you go below 800px or 450px, stop resizing
