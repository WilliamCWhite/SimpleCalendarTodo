# Simple Calendar-Task WebApp
![Image?](/Demo%20Image.png)

My goal with this project was to learn a lot of HTML, CSS and JavaScript concepts before trying to do anything more advanced with web development. The codebase is an absolute mess since I was just getting the hang of things, but the app itself works perfectly. It's fully responsive to different landscape resolutions, and gets around my lack of database knowledge with localStorage (stored in the browser files).
